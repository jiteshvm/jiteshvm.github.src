Finally its live. Once again, I have resurrected my blog. <br />
In the past, I have started a blog multiple times, but never quite maintained it or updated it with any content.
I am good at starting / trying out new things but not very good at transforming it into a habit.
So, lets try again.
I'm going to develop the habit of updating this blog as much as I can.
How about making a list of ideas that I can blog about?

- Teach a math concept to myself
- Teach a programming concept to myself
- Explain how I solved a particular coding problem
- Write about that book I have been reading
- Write about that side-project I am working on
- Dissect that game I have been playing
- Sharing some piano learning would be great
- Random rant

I have already started thinking about the next blog update. So, here we go!
